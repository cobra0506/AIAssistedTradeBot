## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### File: `config.py`

#### Essential Settings
```python
# API Settings
------------
BYBIT_API_KEY = os.getenv('BYBIT_API_KEY', '')
BYBIT_API_SECRET = os.getenv('BYBIT_API_SECRET', '')
API_BASE_URL = 'https://api.bybit.com'

# Data Settings
-------------
SYMBOLS = ['BTCUSDT', 'ETHUSDT', 'SOLUSDT']  # Custom symbols
TIMEFRAMES = ['1', '5', '15']  # Time intervals (minutes)
DATA_DIR = 'data'  # CSV storage directory

# Collection Modes
----------------
LIMIT_TO_50_ENTRIES = False  # True=50 recent entries, False=all data
FETCH_ALL_SYMBOLS = True  # True=all Bybit symbols, False=config.SYMBOLS
DAYS_TO_FETCH = 100  # Historical data depth

# Real-time Data
--------------
ENABLE_WEBSOCKET = True  # Enable real-time streaming
RUN_INTEGRITY_CHECK = False  # Run data validation
RUN_GAP_FILLING = False  # Auto-fill data gaps

# Performance
-----------
BULK_BATCH_SIZE = 20  # Concurrent requests per batch
BULK_REQUEST_DELAY_MS = 10  # Delay between batches (ms)
BULK_MAX_RETRIES = 5  # Maximum retry attempts

Configuration Strategies 
For AI/ML Training 
python

LIMIT_TO_50_ENTRIES = False  # Maximum historical data
FETCH_ALL_SYMBOLS = True  # Comprehensive dataset
DAYS_TO_FETCH = 100  # Deep historical context
ENABLE_WEBSOCKET = True  # Continuous updates
 
For Strategy Testing 
python

LIMIT_TO_50_ENTRIES = True  # Focused recent data
FETCH_ALL_SYMBOLS = False  # Specific symbols only
DAYS_TO_FETCH = 7  # Recent data only

For Historical Analysis 
python
