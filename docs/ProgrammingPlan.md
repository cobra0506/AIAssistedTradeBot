## 📊 About Message Queues

Since you asked about message queues (Redis/RabbitMQ), here's a simple explanation:

A message queue is a component that allows different parts of your system to communicate asynchronously. Instead of components directly calling each other, they send messages through the queue. This provides:

1. **Decoupling**: Components don't need to know about each other directly
2. **Reliability**: Messages aren't lost if a component is temporarily down
3. **Scalability**: Multiple instances can process messages from the same queue
4. **Load Balancing**: Work can be distributed across available resources

For your Windows-based system, you could consider:
- **Redis**: Lightweight, fast, and easy to set up on Windows
- **RabbitMQ**: More feature-rich, but slightly more complex to configure

However, for a single PC system, you might not need a full message queue system initially. You could implement a simpler in-memory message passing mechanism and upgrade to a proper message queue if needed.

This plan provides a clear roadmap for developing your trading bot system with a modular, "plug-in" approach that allows for thorough testing of each component before integration.
