About Message Queues 
Since you asked about message queues (Redis/RabbitMQ), here's a simple explanation: 
A message queue is a component that allows different parts of your system to communicate asynchronously. Instead of components directly calling each other, they send messages through the queue. This provides: 
1.	Decoupling: Components don't need to know about each other directly
2.	Reliability: Messages aren't lost if a component is temporarily down
3.	Scalability: Multiple instances can process messages from the same queue
4.	Load Balancing: Work can be distributed across available resources
For your Windows-based system, you could consider: 
•	Redis: Lightweight, fast, and easy to set up on Windows
•	RabbitMQ: More feature-rich, but slightly more complex to configure
However, for a single PC system, you might not need a full message queue system initially. You could implement a simpler in-memory message passing mechanism and upgrade to a proper message queue if needed. 
Key Design Considerations 
1.	Component Independence: Each component should be self-contained and testable
2.	Consistent Interface: All components should follow a standard interface pattern
3.	Parallel Processing: Design for parallel execution throughout the system
4.	Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and recovery in all components
5.	Configuration-Driven: Use configuration files to control behavior without code changes
This plan provides a clear roadmap for developing your trading bot system with a modular, "plug-in" approach that allows for thorough testing of each component before integration.
