AI Assisted TradeBot - Optimization Engine Plan (Updated with Testing Strategy) 
Project Vision 

Create a comprehensive optimization system that: 

     Optimizes existing trading strategies for maximum performance
     Automatically discovers new effective strategy combinations
     Tests strategies across multiple symbols to avoid overfitting
     Selects the best strategy for each market condition and symbol
     Enables trading across all perpetual symbols on Bybit
     Focuses on frequent trading opportunities across multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m)
     

Testing Philosophy 

CRITICAL IMPORTANCE: We will implement a rigorous testing strategy that tests every component after each section is completed. This ensures that: 

     Each component works as expected before moving to the next phase
     We catch issues early when they are easier to fix
     We avoid having to revisit completed phases for adjustments
     The final system is reliable and robust
     

Testing Principles 

     Test-Driven Development: Write tests before implementing functionality where possible
     Comprehensive Coverage: Test all functions, methods, and edge cases
     Automated Testing: All tests must be automated and runnable with a single command
     Continuous Integration: Tests run automatically when code is committed
     Performance Testing: Ensure components meet performance requirements
     Integration Testing: Verify that components work together correctly

Important Implementation Notes 

     

    Testing First: For each component, we will write tests before implementing the functionality where possible. This ensures that tests are thorough and that the implementation meets the requirements. 
     

    Parameter Optimization Approach: We will test all parameter combinations simultaneously (not sequentially) to find the true global optimum. For example, if we have parameters A and B, we'll test all combinations of A and B values, not find the best A and then the best B separately. 
     

    Multiple Symbols from the Start: All optimization will be performed across multiple symbols from the beginning to avoid overfitting to a single symbol. 
     

    Trading Fees and Slippage: These will be included in all optimization calculations from Phase 1 to ensure realistic results. 
     

    Frequent Trading Opportunities: The system will focus on 1m, 5m, and 15m timeframes to generate 20-30 trading opportunities per day across all symbols. 
     

    Indicator Parameter Optimization: In Phase 3, we will optimize both the selection of indicators/signals AND their parameters simultaneously to ensure we don't miss great strategies due to suboptimal parameter settings. 
     

    Testing After Each Section: After completing each section within a phase, we will run all relevant tests to ensure the implementation is correct before moving to the next section. This prevents the accumulation of errors and reduces the need for revisiting completed work.
