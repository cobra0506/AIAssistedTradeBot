I need to create a new trading strategy using the StrategyBuilder system. Here are my requirements:

**Strategy Concept:** [Describe your strategy idea here - e.g., "I want a trend-following strategy that uses MACD and RSI confirmation for BTC and ETH"]

**Strategy Type:** [Choose one: Simple / Complex / Hybrid / Adaptive / Risk-Managed]

**Assets:** [List symbols - e.g., BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, SOLUSDT]

**Timeframes:** [List timeframes - e.g., 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h]

**Market Conditions:** [Describe intended market conditions - e.g., "Trending markets", "Range-bound markets", "High volatility periods", "All market conditions"]

**Risk Tolerance:** [Choose one: Conservative / Moderate / Aggressive]

**Indicators I Want to Use:** [List specific indicators - e.g., RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, SMA crossovers, etc.]

**Signal Logic:** [Describe your entry/exit rules - e.g., "BUY when MACD crosses above signal line AND RSI < 30, SELL when MACD crosses below signal line AND RSI > 70"]

**Special Requirements:** [Any special needs - e.g., "Different parameters for different symbols", "Weighted signal combination", "Trailing stop-loss", etc.]

**Reference Examples:** [Mention any example strategies to use as templates - e.g., "Similar to Strategy_Hybrid but more conservative" or "Like Strategy_Simple_RSI but with additional confirmation"]

Please:
1. Create the complete strategy file following the documentation in `simple_strategy/strategies/examples/README_STRATEGY_CREATION_GUIDE.md`
2. Use the appropriate template from the examples folder
3. Include proper GUI parameters
4. Add comprehensive risk management
5. Follow all best practices from the documentation
6. Make it compatible with the current StrategyBuilder system
7. Test it with the provided examples to ensure it works

The strategy should be ready to use immediately after creation.
